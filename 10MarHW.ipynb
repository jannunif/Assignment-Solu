    "#Ans01 : Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with estimating or inferring the unknown population parameters based on sample data. In estimation statistics, we use sample data to make inferences about the population. Estimation statistics can be divided into two types: point estimation and interval estimation.\n",
    "#        Point estimation involves using a single value, known as a point estimate, to estimate an unknown population parameter. A point estimate is the best estimate of a population parameter based on a sample. For example, if we want to estimate the mean height of all students in a university, we can take a random sample of students and calculate the mean height of the sample. The resulting value is the point estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "#        Interval estimation involves estimating an unknown population parameter by specifying a range of values, known as an interval estimate, within which the true value of the parameter is expected to lie. Interval estimation is more informative than point estimation because it provides a range of values instead of a single value. The interval estimate is calculated based on the sample data and the level of confidence desired. The level of confidence is typically chosen to be 90%, 95%, or 99%."
