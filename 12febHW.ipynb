    "#In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of the program is interrupted, and the interpreter raises an exception object.\n",
    "#Exceptions can occur for a variety of reasons, such as when a program tries to perform an operation that is not supported or when an error occurs in a function call. Python provides a mechanism for handling these exceptions using the try-except block.\n",
    "#On the other hand, a syntax error is a type of error that occurs when a program's syntax is incorrect. These errors typically occur when the interpreter cannot understand the code due to a mistake in the syntax. Examples of syntax errors include forgetting to close a parenthesis or using an incorrect keyword.\n",
    "#The key difference between an exception and a syntax error is that an exception occurs during the execution of a program, while a syntax error occurs before the program is executed. In other words, a syntax error is a type of error that is caught by the interpreter during the parsing phase, whereas an exception is an error that occurs during the execution phase.\n",
    "#To summarize, exceptions are runtime errors that occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors are errors that occur before the program is executed due to incorrect syntax."
