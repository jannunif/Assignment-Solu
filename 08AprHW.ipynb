    "#Ans01: The best regression metric to employ in this situation would be Mean Squared Error (MSE). This metric measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual house prices, and it is commonly used for regression problems. Other regression metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) can also be used. However, MSE is preferred in this situation as it penalizes larger errors more severely than smaller errors and thus places more emphasis on accuracy."
