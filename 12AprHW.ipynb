    "#Ans01: Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) helps reduce overfitting in decision trees through two main mechanisms:\n",
    "#      1)Reducing Variance: By training multiple decision trees on different bootstrap samples of the training data and combining their predictions, Bagging reduces the variance of the ensemble model. Each decision tree in the ensemble learns from a slightly different subset of the training data, leading to diverse models. When combining the predictions of these models, the errors and biases of individual trees tend to cancel out, resulting in a more robust and generalized prediction. This reduction in variance helps to mitigate overfitting, as the ensemble model is less sensitive to noise and individual variations in the training data.\n",
    "#      2)Stabilizing Decision Boundaries: Decision trees are prone to high variance and can create complex, overfitted decision boundaries that closely fit the training data. Bagging introduces randomness by training each decision tree on a different bootstrap sample, which leads to variations in the decision boundaries of individual trees. When the predictions of these trees are combined, the ensemble model tends to have smoother and more stable decision boundaries, reducing the risk of overfitting to the training data and improving generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "# Overall, bagging with decision trees reduces overfitting by combining the predictions of multiple trees trained on different subsets of the data, reducing variance and stabilizing decision boundaries."
