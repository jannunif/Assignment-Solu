    "#Ans01 : Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves writing a program or script that automates the process of visiting a website, navigating to specific pages, and extracting information from those pages.

    "# 01) Parsing HTML      : This method involves parsing the HTML of a website using a programming language like Python. This can be done using a library like Beautiful Soup, which allows developers to extract specific data from the HTML.\n",
    "# 02) Web Scraping Tools: There are many web scraping tools available that can be used to extract data from websites. These tools typically allow users to select the data they want to extract using a visual interface, and then export it in a variety of formats.\n",
    "# 03) APIs              : Many websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access data in a structured format. This is typically the easiest and most reliable way to access data from a website, as the data is provided in a format specifically designed for machine consumption.\n",
    "# 04) Browser Extensions: Some browser extensions like Web Scraper and Data Miner can be used for web scraping. These extensions allow users to scrape data from websites in a visual interface without needing to write code.\n",
    "# 05) Headless Browsers : Headless browsers like Puppeteer and Selenium can be used to automate web scraping. These browsers allow developers to simulate user interactions with a website, which can be used to extract data from dynamic websites."
