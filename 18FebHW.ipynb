    "#Ans01 : API stands for Application Programming Interface. It's a set of protocols, routines, and tools used to build software applications. Essentially, an API specifies how software components should interact with each other.\n",

    "# Example :  API being used in real life is when you use a social media app on your phone, such as Instagram or Facebook. These apps have APIs that allow other developers to create new tools and services that can be integrated with the social media platform. For example, a developer could create a tool that automatically posts to your Instagram account at a specific time each day, or a tool that analyzes your Facebook profile to give you insights into your social media usage."

    "\n",
    "# Flexibility    : APIs offer a high level of flexibility by allowing software developers to customize and tailor their applications to their specific needs.\n",
    "# Efficiency     : APIs can help reduce development time and costs by providing pre-built components and tools that can be easily integrated into new applications.\n",
    "# Integration    : APIs make it possible to integrate different systems and applications, allowing data and services to be shared seamlessly between different software components.\n",
    "# Standardization: APIs provide a standardized way for different applications to communicate with each other, which makes it easier to build and maintain complex software systems.\n",
    "# Innovation     : APIs enable third-party developers to create new applications and services that can work with existing software systems, leading to innovation and new business opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Disadvantages of using API:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Security Risks : APIs can be vulnerable to security risks, especially when they are not properly secured or authenticated. Hackers may be able to exploit vulnerabilities in the API to gain access to sensitive data.\n",
    "# Dependency     : Applications that rely heavily on APIs may become dependent on them, which can be problematic if the API is no longer available or supported.\n",
    "# Complexity     : APIs can be complex and difficult to understand, especially for non-technical users. This can make it challenging for developers to integrate them into their applications.\n",
    "# Documentation  : The quality and availability of API documentation can vary widely, which can make it difficult for developers to understand how to use the API effectively.\n",
    "# Compatibility  : APIs may not be compatible with all software platforms, which can limit their usefulness in certain situations."

REST APIs are designed around resources, which are identified by URIs, and use a limited number of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on these resources. REST is highly scalable and easy to implement, making it a popular choice for web applications.\n",

    "#SOAP, on the other hand, is a more complex and heavyweight architecture that uses XML-based messaging to transfer data between client and server. SOAP APIs require a full specification of the message format, including headers and message bodies, and can use a variety of communication protocols. SOAP provides more advanced features such as security, reliable messaging, and transaction support, but at the cost of increased complexity and overhead."

    "Request method         : REST APIs use a limited number of HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources, while SOAP APIs use a standardized XML-based protocol for all requests and responses.\n",
    "Caching                : REST APIs support caching to improve performance, while SOAP APIs do not.\n",
    "Security       : Both REST and SOAP can support security protocols such as HTTPS and SSL, but SOAP offers more advanced security features such as WS-Security and WS-Trust.\n",
    "Scalability: REST is considered more scalable than SOAP because it is based on stateless communication and simple message formats."
