    "#ans02 The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data within a single unit (class), and restricting access to the internal data from outside the class. This ensures data integrity and provides a way to hide the complexity of the implementation from the user.\n",
    "#Abstraction  : Abstraction is the process of representing the essential features of an object without showing the implementation details. It allows us to focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it. Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction in OOP.\n",
    "#Inheritance  : Inheritance is the ability of a class (child or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent or base class). Inheritance allows us to reuse code and create a hierarchical structure of classes, where the child classes inherit the features of the parent class and can add their own unique features as well.\n",
    "#Polymorphism : Polymorphism is the concept of having multiple forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class, through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding is when a child class provides its own implementation for a method that is already defined in the parent class, while method overloading is when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Polymorphism makes code more flexible and adaptable, and helps to avoid code duplication."
