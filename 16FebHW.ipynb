    "#Ans01 : A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed on a computer system. It is designed to enable efficient data storage, retrieval, and modification. Databases are used in a wide range of applications, from simple address books to complex enterprise resource planning systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems. Here are the main differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1) Data Structure  : SQL databases are based on a structured data model, where data is stored in tables with predefined columns and rows. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are based on a non-structured data model, where data can be stored in various formats, including document-oriented, graph-based, and key-value.\n",
    "#2) Query Language  : SQL databases use a standard query language called SQL to interact with the database. SQL allows users to perform complex queries, insert, update, delete, and retrieve data. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, have their own query languages or APIs that are specific to the type of database.\n",
    "#3) Scalability     : NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, meaning they can handle large amounts of data by adding more servers to the cluster. SQL databases, on the other hand, are designed to scale vertically, meaning they can handle larger amounts of data by adding more processing power and memory to a single server.\n",
    "#4) Data Consistency: SQL databases prioritize data consistency over scalability, meaning all data in the database is always consistent and up-to-date. NoSQL databases prioritize scalability over consistency, meaning data may not always be consistent in a distributed environment.\n",
    "#5) Flexibility     : NoSQL databases are more flexible than SQL databases, allowing developers to easily modify the data structure as needed. SQL databases, on the other hand, have a rigid schema that is difficult to change once it is set."
